Testing 

1) /adde something (that is just the name of the event) not working 

2) /addf with /adde format will still add it as a 
floating event 

3) /adde with the format /adde meeting 8:00 24/03/2014
- 24/03/2014 will throw exception

4) include optional priority with space bar, currnetly 
it does not ignore the whitespace  for both adde and addt

5) re-entry of the priority after entering it wrongly does not 
yeild anything

6) there is no reset for the /adde function 
especially if there was 

7) When input inside the tables for both tasks and event 
go beyond 6 inputs, the next input cuts off half way
Solution: need to scroll up and then back down to see the 
input properly 

8) adding something does not show succesful add message

9) Task/event table has portion of a column (scrolling right, after End Time)

10) entering the /adde without end date sets it to be 31/12/9999

11) the table "jumps" a little every time when we write something in if there 
are more than 6 tasks

12) hitting just enter and then trying to type in a new command will only display the 
error message but does not register subsequent commands (only if the previous command was 
an /adde)

13) Hitting !q after entering a nothing does not quit the feedback message but other dt and de work

14) Deleting tasks also causes the table to be cut off
